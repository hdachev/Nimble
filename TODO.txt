1. Temporary Render Targets

A refactoring of the render target cache/aliasing system.
Remove intermediate render targets are replace them with "Temporary Render Targets" ala Unity.
You simply fill a TempRenderTargetDesc structure with the render target dimensions and format and the render target cache will return a render target
that fits the given description from the cache. If there's no suitable RT in the cache, allocate a new one. Inputs/Outputs of RenderNodes will also be 
"Temporary Render Targets" once they are outside of their lifetimes. RT's that have no lifetimes are "Pure Temporary".

The render target cache will be made up of a HashMap which will be looked up using a hash of the TempRenderTargetDesc structure.
Each element of this HashMap will be of type RenderTargetPool.

struct RenderTargetPool
{
    std::vector<RenderTarget> input_output_rts;
    std::vector<RenderTarget> pure_temp_rts;
};

When a temp RT is requested, the cache will first take the hash of the TempRenderTargetDesc structure and use that to lookup the relevant RenderTargetPool. If it doesn't exist, create it.
Once obtained it'll take the first element of the pure_temp_rts array and swap-and-pop the element with the last element. If it is empty, check the RT's in the input_output_rts array one by one 
and see if there is any RT that is outside of its' lifetime. If there is, swap-and-pop it with the last element. If unable to find an RT from here as well, create a new "Pure Temporary" render target
and return it. Once a temp RT is used, you must return it to the cache, where it'll be added to the end of either the pure_temp_rts array or input_output_rts array.
